## /boot/cmdline.txt

```txt
no_console_suspend root=/dev/ram0 rootwait androidboot.hardware=rpi4 androidboot.selinux=permissive console=tty1
```

The `console=tty1` parameter directs kernel messages and the Linux console to tty1, leaving tty0 free for other purposesâ€”such as uart communication avoiding conflict.

## /boot/config.txt

```txt
# Serial console
enable_uart=1
```
